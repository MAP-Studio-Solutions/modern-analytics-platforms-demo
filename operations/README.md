# Finance — Domain Overview (Placeholder)

This folder is reserved for the Finance analytics domain.  
The domain will follow the same structure as the Workforce domain, including:

- a domain-level README describing the business model  
- a methods/ folder containing simple method summaries  
- one folder per implementation method (Databricks-native, dbt, Genie)

This placeholder will be replaced once the domain is fully defined.
